    "### Goals of the Notebook Lectures this week\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you learned some important tools for summarizing data in R.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- For categorical variables with a small number of categories, you learned to create **one-way** and **two-way tables**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- And for continuous variables or those with many categories, you used **histograms** and **scatterplots**. \n",
    "\n",
    "One-way tables and histograms allow you to study the distribution of the values of a single variable. Two-way tables and scatterplots, however, tell us something about the **association** between two variables. Studying associations is an important part of answering the kinds of questions we will ask in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember: associations may or may not be evidence of a causal relationship between variables---as we'll discuss more next week! \n",
    "But learning to analyze associations is an important tool for data analysis, whether causality is in the picture or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recorded lecture this week, we'll look at an additional tool for summarizing the association between two variables: the **correlation coefficient**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient can be a useful measure of association (though I will also talk in the recording about cases where it is not useful, or can even be misleading).  We will use the correlation coefficient again later in the semester, when we study bivariate regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get ready to understand correlation, we will first need to study two other important concepts using R: the **average** and the **standard deviation** of a variable.  We'll also learn what it means to **standardize** a variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That's what we'll do in this lecture, and then you'll be ready to learn about the correlation coefficient using R in the recorded lecture."

    "The standard deviation is a measure of \"spread\".  It measures how far from the average of a list a \"typical\" entry on the list.  For example, if our variable is <code>life expectancy</code>, measured for each country in years, the standard deviation tells us about how far from the average of 64.5 years we might expect a typical country to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the **standard deviation** of a variable, we follow the following steps:\n",
    "- Calculate the average of the variable;\n",
    "- Take the difference between the value of the variable for each unit and the average. (That is, take the difference between the number in each cell in a column and the overall average of the column).\n",

    "A minor side note: by default, to get the average of the squared differences, the R function<code>sd()</code>divides by the number of units minus 1, rather than simply the number of units. For example, here the units are countries, and there there are 131 countries in the data set; thus, when you use<code>sd()</code>, R divides the sum of the squared differences from average by 130, not 131. This is because sometimes in statistics dividing by $n-1$ rather than $n$ (where $n$ is the number of entries on a list) is the right thing to do. But it's not the right thing to do here.  \n",
