    "\n",
    "- Next, you need to divide by the standard deviation of variable_name. (Here, you can choose to use the variable where you stored the sd of variable_name in Question 2 if you like). For dividing, remember the \"/\" operator in R!  \n",

It may be useful/necessary to surround the expression in the numerator in parentheses, so that R knows there is one thing in the numerator divided by another thing in the denominator.\n",

    "- **Please keep trying to upload to Gradescope past the individual assignment deadline even if you could not do so initially**---Gradescope will remain open for late submissions, and if you have emailed the full file to your GSI on time (if you could not do the upload in time), you will receive credit for an ontime submission.  However, **you need to upload to Gradescope to receive your grade for the assignment** (based on Gradescope's autograding capacity)."
