    "## Week 2, Lecture 2: Data summaries for continuous variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first Notebook Lecture in class this week, we talked about using one-way and two-way tables to summarize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a useful way to handle summaries of **categorical variables**---those that take on a limited number of values (i.e., categories).  \n",
    "\n",
    "But we saw that was not such a useful approach for **continuous variables**, or those that can take on many values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility we discussed is collapsing the values of continuous variables into several categories. For intance, we can use GDP per capita to describe countries as \"low income,\" \"middle income,\" or \"rich\" and then use tables to summarize the numbers of countries in each category. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, however, it is useful to retain the richer information included in continuous variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lecture, you'll learn two techniques in R to make one-way and two-way summaries for continuous variables, or those with many values. \n",
    "For one-way (one-dimensional) summaries we'll use **histograms**.  And for two-way (two-dimensional) summaries we'll use **scatterplots**.\n"
